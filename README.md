## Welcome!
This is a fork of the [FTC app](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) that has been set up as a self-contained tutorial for rookie teams who
want to learn Java programming.

### Downloading
To download this project, just use the 'Clone/Download' button to download a zip file of the project and extract it somewhere.

### Requirements
Before you start working on this, you should have:  
* A 2-wheel-drive robot  
* Basic FTC robot controller/driver station control setup  
* A REV Robotics color sensor and a touch sensor (these come with the REV hub starter kit)  
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)  

### Getting Started
First, open your project in Android Studio (the correct folder should be green).  
![Opening the project](https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/ftc_hello_tutorial/blob/master/doc/readme/opening.png)  
When it loads, it should look like this:  
![First load](https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/ftc_hello_tutorial/blob/master/doc/readme/workspace.png)  
In the file tree on the left, there are two folders: `FtcRobotController` and `TeamCode`. `FtcRobotController` contains the low-level code to run
the app, and `TeamCode` is where your robot code resides. To begin the tutorial, navigate into
`TeamCode/java/.../lesson1` and open the `README.txt` file.
